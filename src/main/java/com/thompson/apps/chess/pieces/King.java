		 * King Logic per Wikipedia:
		 * 
		 * A king moves one square in any direction. Once in every game, each king can
		 * make a special move, known as castling. Castling consists of moving the king
		 * two squares along the first rank toward a rook on the player's first rank,
		 * and then placing the rook on the last square that the king crossed. Castling
		 * is permissible if the following three conditions are met: 1. neither the king
		 * nor the rook has previously moved during the game 2. there are no pieces
		 * between the king and the rook 3. the king is not in check, and will not pass
		 * through or land on any square attacked by an enemy piece. (Note that castling
		 * is permitted if the rook is under attack, or if the rook crosses an attacked
		 * square.)
